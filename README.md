# Aeon Desktop Project Repository

## Purpose

This GitHub repo serves as the "one stop shop" for all Aeon Desktop Project services that aren't handled elsewhere. It's main functions are

* Bug tracker - File any issues with Aeon Desktop at https://github.com/AeonDesktop/Project/issues
* Wiki - All general Aeon documentation should be written in https://github.com/AeonDesktop/Project/wiki
* Discussions (Beta) - Discussion Aeon at https://github.com/AeonDesktop/Project/discussions (Note, this is a trial, and may be removed in favour for keeping everyone focused on our Telegram group at https://t.me/AeonDesktop)
* Official File Repo - The file contents of this repository are intended for 'official' documents that may not be practical to be kept in the wiki, such as official logos, policies, etc
